# simple-portfolio
This is a basic portfolio I built to showcase my knowledge amd skills as a front-end developer. The website contains some of the notable projects I have worked on and some information about myself and how I can be contacted incase of collarborations or oppurtunities.

This website is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript and it is responsive and follows the use of best practices. I look forward to getting feedback annd comments on how to improve on myself.

Thank y'all.
